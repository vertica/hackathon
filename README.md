## Install the vertica python client and other dependencies
First you need to install the vertica python client, so that you can connect to the database by simply writing python code.

There are a few requirements for that. First, you need to install pip. If you are using Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 downloaded from python.org you will already have pip. Otherwise follow installation instructions here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

If you are using pip >= 1.4 and you don't already have pytz installed:
    pip install --pre pytz
    
To install vertica-python with pip run the following command with sudo priviledges:

    sudo pip install vertica-python

You will get a prompt to enter your password. Enter your password and hit enter.

More instructions and source code of the python client at: https://github.com/uber/vertica-python

## Install Flask, a python framework and submit your first query

Flask is a powerfull and lightweight python framework. It does all the dirty work of setting up a server. You can install it with:

    sudo pip install flask

Run your demo server that submits a select 1 query:

    cd server
    python server.py
    
Visit localhost:5000 to see the Hello World page.
